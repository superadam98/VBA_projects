# VBA_projects

Project that will be focues on creating a nested project management tool within excel. Can be easily imported to servers for colaborative work.
Planned updates: 
1) Cleaning up code and unused variables
2) Writing notes for code
3) adding a function during the save process that can add lines after a child gantt chart is created
4) adding a function that will load new lines to a parent if a new subproject is created on a child
5) add to functions so the actual cost field can get automatically updated as it is requested
6) add the ability to approve certain budget requirements
7) potentially have start or end dates interact with the (today)names space so gantt chart can function exactly like a regular chart
Other planned excel sheets
1) self updating nested price list
2) self updating nested costs list
3) self updating nested Method of Manufacturing/Bill of materials List
4) welcome to other ideas!
